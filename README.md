# Star_Wars_Intro

Being a star wars fan and a budding developer I always insert star wars reference in my code. But One time I got an idea to make a star wars effect intro using HTML-CSS
and Javascript and I thought it would be cooler as well as it will improve my knowledge in CSS. In some places I got stuck (Well I am still a noob) so I followed some youtube 
channels too. But overall it is worth it and yes, There is still a lot more to add inside. Thought of adding the classic star wars music while scrolling but came to know that 
I cannot, due to google has changed their audio policies on their chrome browser.
